<h1>How do civilisations decay and how you can avoid it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-civilisations-decay-and-how-you-can-avoid-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>History has served us many good rulers, who had led their lands to prosperity. Art and science had flourished under their rule. They have all decayed, eventually. How and why does this happen? Who is your enemy that will defeat you? Mark my words, most of what follows is true for civilisations, communities, individuals and hobby clubs at IITB alike.</p>
<p>This enemy that I mentioned is omnipotent. The qualities, habits and values that lead you to success today would start to fail tomorrow. Many a wise have been lost, confused and unable to understand the magic of this enemy. This enemy is called time.</p>
<p>You cannot defeat time. You can, however, defend. Forever. Here goes the manual for every situation you will encounter, that I can think of.</p>
<div class="section" id="trivially-timeless-strategies">
<h2>Trivially Timeless Strategies<a class="headerlink" href="#trivially-timeless-strategies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You have a challenge before you, say it be conducting an event or laying siege to a fortress. You come up with a smart idea. It works well. You succeed. Later, you face a similar challenge. You would be tempted to try out the same smart idea, and you would be right in doing so.</p>
<p>And that’s why I call this the trivial case. No lessons here, let us go on to the next one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deceptively-timeless-strategies">
<h2>Deceptively Timeless Strategies<a class="headerlink" href="#deceptively-timeless-strategies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The background setting is the same as the previous situation. Except here when you face the similar challenge, the smart idea that you are whipping around as your trump card is not so smart. Perhaps it worked for the first time because there was some other hidden factor at play which you did not think of. Maybe there was another event right next to yours which was boring, and that is why you had a more significant audience. Or maybe your audience had some further incentive that you did not explicitly provide or even thought of. Perhaps you won the war because the enemy was weaker due to a famine in their territory. If we were so utterly diligent that we could precisely pinpoint what factors have worked in our favour, then I would not need to write so much. This is how time deceives you. It secretly works in your favour sometimes and gives you the feeling of being on the right path. Always remember, winning a war does not prove that your methods were better. Smoothly succeeding at a task does not show that you are naturally good at it. Struggling a lot and eventually succeeding at a task does not prove that now you have learnt well.</p>
<p>Differentiating between the last two situations is all of the non-triviality that lies here. To summarise, please be aware that you are not entirely correct just because your method worked out once, or twice, or any number of times. If you don’t have this attitude, time will get back at you. And it’s pretty when that happens. The Mughals spun off the Timurid Dynasty who claimed to be the descendants of the great Genghis Khan enjoyed years of sovereign rule in India. Akbar was a curious man, a hobbyist in various arts and sciences. Yet, he discarded the idea of building a navy because their dynasty had enjoyed years of rule on land with military power based on horses. This was contemporary to European powers gaining naval control of sea around the Indian subcontinent and discovering new ways of battle. He is known to have admired the idea of a printing press when it was first presented to him. In retrospect, printing would have helped his administrative abilities beyond measure. He did not actively pursue it, however. This was partly because Europeans failed to make typecasts for Indian scripts, and were more interested in proselytising Christianity via printing Bible. But we should not neglect the difference an active pursuit by Akbar would have made.</p>
<p>Now, understand that it is actually easy to look at history and point mistakes. This is just like people propagating stories of how they were rejected by some company for a small job, and now they are more successful that they would have been with that company, or perhaps have a venture larger than that company. This retrospective ideology does not take you forward. Those companies would have rejected many other applicants as well, who were indeed not fit enough. Similarly, Akbar would have rejected many other ideas, not known in history, which were indeed not good enough to be spending time on. Am I about to tell you a strategy to identify which ideas are excellent? No, there is no such strategy. All I want is for you to be aware of this dilemma. You must know the tricks time will play on you. Perhaps you would then be better equipped, but there is no definitive strategy that you can always rely on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="failed-strategies">
<h2>Failed Strategies<a class="headerlink" href="#failed-strategies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a perfect analogy to the previous section, there may be some ideas that fail today. Do not forget them. Do not wholly discard them. They might work tomorrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-cares-give-it-a-shot">
<h2>Who cares? Give it a shot<a class="headerlink" href="#who-cares-give-it-a-shot" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the lack of a definite strategy, I can suggest you one good practice that might be helpful. Whenever an idea strikes you, or somebody else throws it at you. Evaluate it like this.
Do I have objective reasons and examples why would this work/not work? If Yes, are those reasons and examples really applicable in the present? Think. If Yes, then go ahead with your judgement.
If you’ve answered No at any point in the previous paragraph, just forget about logic and give the idea a shot. Any logical decision at this point is imperfect because your information about the scenario is incomplete.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lack-of-momentum-decays">
<h2>Lack of momentum decays<a class="headerlink" href="#lack-of-momentum-decays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another perspective of looking at the decline of civilisations is the lack of momentum that they get at their peak. In the context of WnCC, think of it like this. If you have many ideas to implement, expand, improve the club infrastructure, then you will spend your tenure making progress in the direction. Assuming all goes well and you are the ideal ruler that we have envisioned to build, after a few tenures, you might run out of things to do. This inherently causes decay because you are likely to be resistant to new ideas thinking that there is nothing wrong with the current situation and everything is already perfect. This is time giving a direct blow at you, and you would decline before you even realise. The counter-intuitive strategy for this is to break things just for the sake of it. Change the definition of perfect until everything is imperfect. Henry Ford said that if he asked the people what they want, they’d have asked for faster horses. You need to invent, and you need to disrupt just for the sake of it if you wish to see a change in this world. If our ancestors had not done this, then we might have stopped at agriculture and food security. You want to discover things that you don’t know that you don’t know. You want to build things which you don’t know if you need. Perhaps discontinue an event that has been successful every year for the past 10 years to give way to a new one which will not be as successful for a few years, or maybe never. Maybe you would get back to the old event after the next five years. Do not worry. It is all good as long as it has momentum. The day everything around you seems peaceful, take a hammer and bring chaos to the world. If you have nothing to strive for, you are already dead.</p>
