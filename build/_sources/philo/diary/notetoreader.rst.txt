Note to the Reader
==================
I am writing this as my tenure to the manager of Web n Coding Club is
approaching an end. There are loads of things that we discovered, 
me and Kalpesh, my co-manager which we wish to pass upon you, 
so that you don't have to rediscover them as we had to.

I have no idea, at this point of time, if the journal is full when you read
this but I bestow upon you the responsibility to add to this, as you experience
the adventure and thrill of becoming the manager of this prestigious club.
