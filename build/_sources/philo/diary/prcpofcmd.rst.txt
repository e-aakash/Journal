On the Philosophy and Principles by Which You Shall Command
===========================================================
There is a reason we do not contact companies in an aggressive fashion to
generate sponsors and partners. And you must understand that. There will come
a time when you get a serious urge to do this because every other organisation
inside the institute will be doing the same, if you haven't already dreamt of
doing this. We don't market companies, at most we act as a medium to
communicate about their events/incentives to our audience.

    We are fundamentally a HOBBY club.
