Why does this section exist?
============================

Decemeber 2016, the winter of my tenure, we made the WnCC Wiki. Our forefathers,
the past managers, told me that this was the third WnCC wiki that exists. This
is not the only example of what I like to call a "zionic" situation. Soon
after Varun Bhalerao joined as a professor in the Department of Physics, he
mentioned in an informal meet that Krittika - the Astronomy Club founded by them
circa 2002 was definitely not the first astronomy club in the institute as they
found observation records by Yogesh Wadadekar from over a decade ago, who is
now a faculty at NCRA, Pune. This was not about a coding club, but the following
is. IITB Mailing Lists has something known as
`Programmers Club <http://lists.iitb.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/programmers-club>`_.
They have an archive, but I believe that no administrators remain in the
institute for no one has accepted by joining request yet. This is probably a
relic from the early ages of the internet. IITB Mailing Lists is that old.

Now let me explain what is a 'zionic' situation. I have derived this word
from the fate of the city of Zion [#]_ in the Matrix series. Spoiler Alert! The
citizens of the city believe that they built the city 100 years ago, but in
reality, it is the 6th city. There were 5 more Zions before theirs, all
destroyed and conveniently forgotten. This is natural world order. On a larger
scale, this happens to civilisations too. Civilisations rise and decay like
seasons on this planet. Why do we remember them then? What keeps us rooted
into our ancient history, even if it is a tiny glimpse of it that we remember?

The answer is simple. They have left behind evidence of their glory. It is
common human tendency to bathe in pride of what their ancestors have left them.
This energises them to not only live up to their ancestors, but be bigger and
better. This whole journal is the evidence of our conquest.

A separate section on philosophy is dedicated to the non-technical education
that we wish to impart upon you. Your technical skills would climb you mountains,
but these would help you build a fort there. 

Know that you have to take all of this with a pinch of salt. They might lose
context and instrumental value maybe within a semester, or maybe never. Take
your own decisions, evaluate our words against the right background. If you're
reading this, understand that you are the king/queen. We are only your advisors.

.. [#] Zion is also a synonym for Jerusalem. Connect the dots.
