Time Forever Favours the Young
==============================

There are philsophers who argue that agriculture was an *incorrect* step in
the history of mankind. But it can support a larger amount of population, thus
a community that relies on agriculture will outlive a community of hunter-gatherers
in comparison. Printing was an *incorrect* step according to many. The information revolution
has spoiled the generation of today, so you would hear from the old. 

Thus, here goes the simple fact. It does not matter if you do not believe in your
young, your juniors, their ideas. Nature does not serve the one who is right.
It serves the one who survives. You are going to die (or graduate) before them
leaving the world to them. They shall prevail and you shall be easily forgotten.

In the end, time forever favours the young.
